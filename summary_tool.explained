The algorithm is:
1. Find all sentence scores
	a. For each sentence in "content", find it's intersection(number of common words) with every other sentence. 
	b. The sum of all it's intersections is its "score"
2. For each paragraph in the content, locate the best sentence. This is achieved by locating the sentence with the highest "score" int that paragraph. 
3. Print the title, followed by the best sentence in each paragraph. You arrive at the gist.
